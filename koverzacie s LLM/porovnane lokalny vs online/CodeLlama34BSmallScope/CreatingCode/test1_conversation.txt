Prompt: provide me an example of decorator pattern in java and include plantuml
Response: The Decorator Pattern is a structural design pattern that lets you attach new behaviors to objects by placing these objects inside special wrapper objects called decorators. 

Here's an example implementation of the Decorator Pattern in Java, followed by a PlantUML diagram:

```java
// The Component interface defines the operations that both concrete components and decorators must implement.
interface Component {
    void operation();
}

// Concrete Components provide default implementations of the operations. There can be several variations of these classes.
class ConcreteComponent implements Component {
    public void operation() {
        System.out.println("ConcreteComponent: Base functionality");
    }
}

// The Decorator class maintains a reference to a Component object and defines an interface that conforms to Component's interface.
abstract class Decorator implements Component {
    protected Component component;
    
    public Decorator(Component c) {
        this.component = c;
    }
    
    public void operation() {
        if (this.component != null) {
            this.component.operation();
        }
    }
}

// ConcreteDecorators call the wrapped object's method and then add something of their own. There can be several variations of these classes.
class ConcreteDecoratorA extends Decorator {
    public ConcreteDecoratorA(Component c) {
        super(c);
    }
    
    @Override
    public void operation() {
        System.out.println("ConcreteDecoratorA: Added functionality before call");
        this.component.operation();
        System.out.println("ConcreteDecoratorA: Added functionality after call");
    }
}

class ConcreteDecoratorB extends Decorator {
    public ConcreteDecoratorB(Component c) {
        super(c);
    }
    
    @Override
    public void operation() {
        System.out.println("ConcreteDecoratorB: Added functionality before call");
        this.component.operation();
        System.out.println("ConcreteDecoratorB: Added functionality after call");
    }
}
```

Here's a PlantUML diagram that represents the structure of classes in the above example:

```plantuml
@startuml
interface Component {
  operation()
}
class ConcreteComponent implements Component {
  operation()
}
abstract class Decorator implements Component {
  component : Component
  --
  operation()
}
class ConcreteDecoratorA extends Decorator {
  operation()
}
class ConcreteDecoratorB extends Decorator {
  operation()
}
ConcreteComponent ..> Component: implements
ConcreteDecoratorA ..> Component: implements
ConcreteDecoratorB ..> Component: implements
ConcreteDecoratorA ..> Decorator: extends
ConcreteDecoratorB ..> Decorator: extends
@enduml
```
Prompt: can you add new decorator that prints "hello" + decorator name. Also provide updated plantuml
Response: Here's an example of a new ConcreteDecoratorC class that adds the functionality of printing "Hello" along with its own name:

```java
class ConcreteDecoratorC extends Decorator {
    public ConcreteDecoratorC(Component c) {
        super(c);
    }
    
    @Override
    public void operation() {
        System.out.println("Hello, I'm ConcreteDecoratorC");
        this.component.operation();
    }
}
```

And here's the updated PlantUML diagram:

```plantuml
@startuml
interface Component {
  operation()
}
class ConcreteComponent implements Component {
  operation()
}
abstract class Decorator implements Component {
  component : Component
  --
  operation()
}
class ConcreteDecoratorA extends Decorator {
  operation()
}
class ConcreteDecoratorB extends Decorator {
  operation()
}
class ConcreteDecoratorC extends Decorator {
  operation()
}
ConcreteComponent ..> Component: implements
ConcreteDecoratorA ..> Component: implements
ConcreteDecoratorB ..> Component: implements
ConcreteDecoratorC ..> Component: implements
ConcreteDecoratorA ..> Decorator: extends
ConcreteDecoratorB ..> Decorator: extends
ConcreteDecoratorC ..> Decorator: extends
@enduml
```
Prompt: can you show me how can i use it?
Response: Sure, here's an example of how to use the decorators with a ConcreteComponent object:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Component c = new ConcreteComponent();
        
        // Create DecoratorA and DecoratorB, passing in the base component.
        Component d1 = new ConcreteDecoratorA(c);
        Component d2 = new ConcreteDecoratorB(d1);
        
        // Now we can call operation() on DecoratorB, which will delegate to DecoratorA, which in turn will delegate to the base component.
        d2.operation();
    }
}
```
Prompt: can you decorate d2 with ConcreteDecoratorC and provide me full code again?
Response: Sure, here's an example of how to use the new ConcreteDecoratorC with a d2 object:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Component c = new ConcreteComponent();
        
        // Create DecoratorA and DecoratorB, passing in the base component.
        Component d1 = new ConcreteDecoratorA(c);
        Component d2 = new ConcreteDecoratorB(d1);
        
        // Now we can call operation() on DecoratorC, which will delegate to DecoratorB, which in turn will delegate to DecoratorA, which in turn will delegate to the base component.
        Component d3 = new ConcreteDecoratorC(d2);
        d3.operation();
    }
}
```
